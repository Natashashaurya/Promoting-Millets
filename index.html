            <p>Millets are one of the oldest foods known to humankind. Their charred grains have been found at the Harappan sites and they are also mentioned in the Vedas (one of the oldest archaeological and literary sources of our subcontinent, respectively). An ancient grain, millets have been used both for our consumption and as animal feed.
			
A gang of millets is out there, like Finger Millet, Foxtail Millet, Pearl Millet, Proso Millet, Little Millet, and Sorghum Millet – they’re the usual suspects! Praised for their rich nutritional content, many nutritionists and medical professionals advocate for millet as a crucial breakfast cereal. Moreover, millet muesli, packed with nutrients, also gets a nod from dietary experts.

Millets, these small-seed grains, are integral members of the grass family, extensively cultivated and enjoyed across various regions worldwide, notably in Asia and Africa. Renowned for their gluten-free nature and packed with fibre, protein, minerals, and antioxidants, millets offer a host of health benefits spanning diabetes, obesity, cholesterol, blood pressure, and digestive concerns.

Additionally, these resilient and environmentally friendly crops thrive in harsh conditions, showcasing their drought-resistant nature. Millets are superfoods. They outshine wheat and rice in many aspects. They are high in both macro-nutrients, like proteins and fats, and micro-nutrients, like iron and calcium. They guard us against many vitamin and mineral deficiencies. They are rich in fibre, are gluten-free, and have a low glycaemic index (GI) which means low impact on your blood sugar. </p>

<h2>2023-Year of Millets in India</h2>
<center><img src='images/iym.jpg'  height='300'></center>
<p>When India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the Union Budget in February 2023, she referred to millets as “shri anna” or the best of all grains. 
The global food system faces many complex challenges, including hunger, malnutrition, an ever-growing global population, limited natural resources and a changing climate. A solution is to enhance sustainable crop production, resilient value chains and consumer access to affordable and varied diets. Millets, in their diversity, can contribute to this solution as affordable sources of nutrients for healthy diets that can be cultivated in various adverse climates and arid regions with minimal external inputs.

The International Year of Millets 2023 was an opportunity to raise awareness of the multiple benefits of millets, from nutrition and health to environmental sustainability and economic development. The Year aimed to strengthen science-policy interaction, facilitate partnerships, mobilize stakeholders to take action on promoting and producing millets, and encourage consumption of millets by the general public.
